<h2>Problem A: Drawing</h2>

<img src="drawing.jpg" height="261" width="306" align="right" alt="Drawing Hands" />

<p>
One day, the Artful Coder saw an interesting shape. He immediately started
wondering if it would be possible to draw it on a piece of paper using a
pencil via one continuous line. After trying for several minutes, he eventually
gave up and started writing a program to automate the procedure.
</p>

<p>
Now, despite his name, the Artful Coder really isn't that good a programmer. He
doesn't know if his own program produces correct output, so he's looking for a
second opinion. Given a description of a shape, determine if it can be drawn in
one continuous motion of a pencil, without backtracking over any already-drawn
line segments. The shape will be given as a collection of straight line
segments, in no particular order, that can only touch at their endpoints.
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>
<p>
The input consists of multiple shapes.  Each shape begins with a single number
0 &lt; <b>N</b> &lt; 1000, which is the number of line segments in the shape.
There are then <b>N</b> lines following, each with four integers <b>a</b>,
<b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, and <b>d</b>, describing a line from <b>(a, b)</b> to
<b>(c, d)</b>.  You may assume that at most one of <b>a = c</b> or <b>b = d</b>
will be true, and that -1000 &lt; <b>a</b>,<b>b</b>,<b>c</b>,<b>d</b> &lt;
1000.</p>

<p>
The input will be terminated with a shape that has <b>N = 0</b>, which should
not be processed.
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>
<p>
Output one line for each input shape, containing either "Impossible" or
"Possible" (without quotes).
</p>
