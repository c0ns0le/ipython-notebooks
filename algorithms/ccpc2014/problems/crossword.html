<h2>Problem C: Coverity Crossword</h2>

<img src="crossword.png" height="300" width="300" align="right" alt="crossword" />

<p>
What is your crossword telling you today? Can you scan your code for patterns,
in the time it takes to get a cup of coffee? You have just landed a job at
Coverity, and your first challenge is to demonstrate your searching and testing
abilities. Can you find and analyze code that looks like random strings? Up to
ten secret messages are hidden in a crossword of size 8x8, and your task is to
determine if they are all present in the code or not. 
</p>

<p>
Secrets are hidden horizontally, from left to right, vertically, from top to
bottom, and diagonally, from top-left to bottom-right. 
</p>


<h3>Input Format</h3>
<p>
The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> (1 ≤ <b>T</b> ≤ 100),
the number of test cases. Then follow <b>T</b> test cases. Each case starts
with an integer <b>N</b> on a line (1 ≤ <b>N</b> ≤ 10), the number of words we
are searching for. Each of the next <b>N</b> lines contains a non-empty string
of length at most 8 characters over the alphabet [A-Z], the words we are
searching for. Then follows 8 lines, each containing a string of exactly 8
characters over the alphabet [A-Z], the <b>i</b>'th horizontal line in the
crossword, from left to right, starting from the topmost line down to the
bottommost line.
</p>


<h3>Output Format</h3>
<p>
For each test case print on a separate line either "Yes" or "No", the answer to
the question "Is it the case that all <b>N</b> messages are present in the
crossword?"
