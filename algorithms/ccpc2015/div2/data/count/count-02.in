You have signed up for the annual Calgary Collegiate Programming Contest
Unlike previous years
participants are not choosing their own team members
but are assigned to teams as follows
Consider we list all participants in alphabetic order
Then Team A consists of the first three participants in this order
Team B consists of the next three participants in this order
Assume that the number N of participants is divisible by three so that every team has exactly
three team members
Assume that every participant has exactly one first
name and exactly one last name the name is spelled
over the lower case characters of the English alphabet
and that no two participants carry the exact same name
The alphabetic order we choose is to first sort in lexicographically
ascending order with respect to last names and then when necessary with respect to first names
So john smith is alphabetized after carla smith
but before bob taylor
Given the name of a participant output the names of the two team mates
