<h2>Problem E: Strfry</h2>

<img src="strfry.png" height="200" width="200" align="right" alt="strfry" />

<p>
In the C programming language, strings are not a native data type. In fact,
they are just an array of characters, with a sentinel NULL value used to denote
the end of the string. Since working with strings is a very important thing to
do in programming languages, the C standard library has several very useful
functions for string manipulation: among them are <b>strcpy</b>, <b>strcmp</b>,
<b>strtol</b>, <b>strtok</b>, <b>strlen</b>, and <b>strcat</b>.</p>

<p>
However, there is one function that not many know about, and even fewer use it:
the <b>strfry</b> function. <b>strfry</b> takes an input string and randomly
swaps a random number of characters.
</p>

<p>
Given two strings, determine if it is possible that the second string is the
first string, strfried.
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>
<p>
The input begins with a number 0 &lt; <b>N</b> &lt; 1001, the number of test
cases.
</p>

<p>
Each test case consists of a single line containing two strings of lowercase
English characters, separated by a single space; these are the two strings in
question. Each string is at most 1000 characters long.
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>
<p>
Output one line for each test case, containing either "Impossible" or
"Possible" (without quotes).</p>

<h3>Sample Input</h3>
<pre>
4
a a
ab ba
ring gnir
newt twan
</pre>

<h3>Sample Output</h3>
<pre>
Possible
Possible
Possible
Impossible
</pre>
